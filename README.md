Case Study: Revenue Decline Analysis | Market Research & Business Strategy
Problem Statement
This case study revolves around a board game manufacturer based in Delhi, facing a decline in sales over the past year. The company specializes in board games like Monopoly, Ludo, etc., and supplies these to third-party distributors. The key focus of this project was to analyze the reasons behind the decline in revenue, specifically targeting the Ludo game, and to provide data-driven recommendations to recover lost sales.

Key Insights
Through a structured demand-supply analysis, we discovered that the major contributing factor to the revenue decline was the shift from physical board games to online gaming platforms. This trend gained momentum due to the COVID-19 lockdowns, with more consumers preferring digital games over traditional ones.

Approach
The analysis was performed using the following framework:

Demand-Supply Analysis
We explored both supply-side and demand-side factors affecting sales. The supply-side remained unchanged, confirming that the issue lay primarily with the demand-side.

4P Framework (Product, Price, Place, Promotion)
We analyzed key demand drivers based on the 4P framework:

Product: Was the product quality or features affecting demand?
Price: Were there any changes in the pricing model or available discounts?
Place: How were the products distributed (online vs offline)?
Promotion: Did the company face any negative publicity, or were competitors running more aggressive campaigns?
Root Cause Analysis
The decline was primarily driven by the increase in online gaming popularity, shifting consumer preferences, and fewer people purchasing physical board games.

Key Findings
Consumer Behavior Shift: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of consumers shifted to online board games and mobile app versions of traditional games like Ludo and Monopoly.
Decline in Product Sales: Ludo, being a classic game, experienced the most significant sales drop.
Supply-Side Stability: There were no significant changes in the supply chain or product quality, reinforcing the focus on demand-side issues.
Recommendations
To help the company recover lost revenue and enhance its market position, the following recommendations were made:

Digital Expansion:
Develop a mobile application or digital version of board games, offering in-app purchases and advertising to generate new revenue streams.

Partnerships with Cafes/Restaurants:
Collaborate with restaurants and cafes to organize game nights and offer prizes to encourage physical board game engagement.

Game Nights & Events:
Host community game nights, collaborating with local venues or virtually to engage customers and revive interest in the brand.

Promotional Campaigns:
Launch targeted promotions and events, such as limited-time discounts or partnerships with influencers to bring attention back to physical board games.

Technologies Used
Data Analysis & Visualization: MS Excel (Pivot Tables, Data Visualization), Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL
Business Analysis Tools: 4P Framework, Market Research, Root Cause Analysis, Trend Analysis
Databases & Tools: MySQL, Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub
Conclusion
This case study demonstrates how market trends and consumer behavior shifts can have a significant impact on product sales. The analysis not only identified the root causes of the revenue decline but also provided strategic recommendations that align with the current market situation, enabling the company to recover and grow in a rapidly evolving market.
